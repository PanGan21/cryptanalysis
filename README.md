Notes on cryptanalysis for my MSc

## !ATTENTION! 
DO NOT USE IN ANY PRODUCTION SYSTEM

The code is written in order to demostrate the core algorithms and protocols

## How to use
Each folder is attempting to explain a cryptographic consept

There is a `main.py` which is the core algorithm/protocol for a specific folder.

In some cases, attacks are being demonstrated for a better understanding of the cryptographic primitives
